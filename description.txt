This mod adds a new accessory type, the bag, that collects certain items for you and stores them inside it beyond max stack sizes (as long as its equipped in the accessory slot).
Use them (left click) to drop the contents on the floor, or left click a chest with the bag selected to try and store its contents into the chest.
Right click with the bag in your hotbar to open up a chest-like UI where you can collect or deposit the bag-appropriate items.

Includes:
- Dirt Bag(for all types of soils and rock), Gem Bag(for gems), Ore Bag (for ores across the tier spectrum), and for all mentioned before, the Omni Bag.
- Wood Bag (woods and acorns), Plant Bag (alchemy plants and pumpkins and their seeds, and sunflowers), Mushroom Bag (Mushrooms and grass seeds), Dye Material Bag (for dye materials) and their collective bag, the Nature Bag.
- Fish Bag (fish and junk), Crate Bag (crates), Bait Bag (Bait, including truffle worm) and their collective bag, the Fishing Bag.
- Coin Bag, a special bag that collects the 4 normal coins and stacks them up into more valuable coins.
- The True Omni Bag, that collects everything that can be stacked (sorted by ItemID)

All bags are crafted with 15 silk and one fallen star at a workbench, all collective bags are crafted with their component bags and a fallen star at the Tinkerer's Workbench and the True Omni Bag is crafted with all Collective bags (including future ones) and two Broken Hero Swords at the Thinkerer's Workbench.

Also included is the "generic bag" that can be extended by other mods using this one as base to create unique bags.

  - True Omni Bag contains instead a "Blacklist" list that prevent items from being stored in the bag.
- Several new Config options for the Bags of holding config, including an option to display an item's tag in the item's tooltip, making it quick to add mod support in your own configs.
- Added compatibility with several new mods and updated some old ones.
  - Due to the way this mod works, it will no longer be possible to update the order list automatically unless it is deleted from the bag's config file.
